# A Difficult Game About Climbing

## What is this game?

A Difficult Game About Climbing is a so-called rage platformer inspired by Getting Over It. In it, you climb a mountain 
made of different terrains with unusual movement controlling, where you actually have to grab the terrain with both 
hands.

## Where is the options page?

The [player options page for this game](../player-options) contains all the options you need to configure
and export a config file.

## What does randomization do to this game?

The gameplay is not randomized in any way, but movement is nerved and certain parts of the in-game world do not 
work (correctly) until you receive a specific item.

## What is the goal of A Difficult Game About Climbing in Archipelago?

Reaching the top of the mountain and completing the game, indicated by the screen turning white.

## Which items can be in another player's world?

- Grip Strength (increases friction of everything you grab)
- Swinging Metal Beam (without it, the metal beam, that you need to swing to continue, will not move)
- Metal Beam Angle Increase (increases the maximum angle to which the metal beam can swing)
- Rotating Cog Repair (without it, all rotating cogs at the second checkpoint will rotate in the opposite direction)
- Rotating Cog Halting (stops all cogs from rotating)
- Side Cog Halting (stops all side cogs from moving the player)
- Deafness Trap (permanently disables all sound in-game)

## What is considered a location check?

Each surface type represents a location that is checked upon grabbing it for the first time. There are a total of 16 
surface types.

## But I'm not that good at the game...

You can adjust the difficulty of the logical requirements in the player options, so that even less skilled players have 
a chance of reaching the top in their world.
